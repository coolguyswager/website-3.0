            <p>Vindinium is a challenge set for programmers where they have to make an AI that can battle and beat other peoples AI's.</p>
            <p>The rules are simple: At the end of 1200 turns the bot with most gold will win. You get gold by collecting mines and you can get mines by beating the goblin who works the mine or killing other bots who own mines and by doing so you are taking the mines they own. Finally if you run out of health you can go to a tavern and spend two gold to heal 50 of you max 100 hp. </p>
            <p>My bot is a bot that only goes after the cloesest mine to me and then if or when I get 50 percent or more of the mines on the map I just sit next to a tavern and heal up. </p>
