                <p>In each computer there are sevaral pieces of hardware. The main ones are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Motherboard</li>
                        <li>CPU</li>
                        <li>RAM</li>
                        <li>Hard drive</li>
                        <li>Power</li>
                        <li>Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The motherboard is like the postal service in which both of them take in information and send it out.</p> <img src = "http://www.ixbt.com/mainboard/foxconn/a7va/board.jpg" id = "motherboard"/>
                    <p>CPU stand for central processing unit. The CPU follows the instructions of programs. It process them and then carries it out.</p> <img src="http://www.maximumpc.com/files/u154082/intel_cpu_socket3.jpg" id="cpu"/>
                    <p>RAM stands for random access memory. It can be somewhat described as multitasking memory. It allows you to do many many things all at once.</p> <img src = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Ram_chip.jpg" id = "ram"/>
                    <p>The hard drive stores all of your data. It is where all of your folders are kept. All of folders and files you make or download go there.</p> <img src = "http://originus.samsung.com/us/business/semiconductor/news/downloads/HybridHardDrive_LG.jpg" id = "hardDrive"/>
                    <p>Every computer needs power or else it wont run. In a laptop the power is in the form of a battery. For a desktop all you do is plug </p> <img src = "http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2009/03/3-14-09-eee-1000he-battery.jpg" id = "power"/>
                    <p>The keyboard, mouse, and monitor are all vital parts of a computer. The keyboard is used to type and input charcters, the mouse is used to click on things, and the monitor is used to display information.</p> <img src = "http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/desktop-pc-computer-monitor-keyboard-labels-mouse-10487644.jpg" id = "kmm"/>
